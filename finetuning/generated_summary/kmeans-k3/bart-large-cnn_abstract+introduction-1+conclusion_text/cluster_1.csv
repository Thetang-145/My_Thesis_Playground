SP:b19df5243359791fbaad005d6f13d7e9fdb0ff63,"This paper proposes a new method for multi - agent learning based on role - based learning. The proposed method first decompose joint action spaces into restricted role action spaces by clustering actions according to their effects on the environment and other agents. Then, a role selector and a role policy are learned in a bi - level learning hierarchy : the role selector searches in a smaller role space and at a lower temporal resolution, while the role policies learn in significantly reduced primitive action - observation spaces. Finally, the proposed method further integrates information about action effects into role policies to boost learning efficiency and policy generalization."
SP:7deb61890d97422a0fe141ca807f968c70ab239a,"This paper studies the behaviour of the stochastic subgradient descent ( SSGD ) method applied to over - parameterized nonsmooth optimization problems that satisfy an interpolation condition. By leveraging the composite structure of the empirical risk minimization problems, the authors prove that SSGD converges, respectively, with rates O(1/ ) and O(log(1 / ) for convex and strongly - convex objectives when interpolation holds. These rates coincide with established rates for SGD methods applied to smooth problems. The analysis provides a partial explanation for the empirical observation that sometimes SGD and SSGD behave similarly for training smooth and nonsmoot machine learning models."

In particular, the authors show that there are multiple non - optimal fixed points under an approximate Bellman operator. To address this problem, they propose a novel value estimator, named doubly bounded estimator that utilizes an abstracted dynamic programming as a lower bound estimation to rule out the potential non - optimality fixed points.

The first step is to generate images in low - frequency bands by training a sampler in the wavelet domain and then super - resolution them back to the pixel - space with a novel wavelet - based down - sampling method. Since the sampler and decoder can be trained in parallel and operate on much lower dimensional spaces than end - to - end models, the training cost is substantially reduced. The model achieves a Fréchet Inception Distance ( FID ) of 10.59 – beating the baseline BigGAN model – at half the compute ( 256 TPU - v3 cores )."

In particular, it shows that under the most basic settings, all student neurons must align with the teacher neuron at any local minima. The authors show that under more general cases, the proof can be reduced to analyzing the properties of a special class of functions that we call angular distance ( AD ) functions. The minimum determinant of the associated matrices are always non - positive unless perfect alignment or the problem degenerates."

The authors show that sampling - insensitive discriminators ( e.g. PointNet-Max ) produce shape point clouds with point clustering artifacts, while sampling - oversensitive discriminators fail to guide valid shape generation. They propose the concept of sampling spectrum to depict the different sampling sensitivities of discriminators. They further study how different evaluation metrics weigh the sampling pattern against the geometry and propose several perceptual metrics forming a sampling spectrum of metrics. They discover a middle - point sampling - aware baseline discriminator, PointNet - Mix, which improves all existing point cloud generators by a large margin on sampling - related metrics."

Instead of increasing the fidelity of models for policy learning, the paper proposes to learn to adapt to diverse simulators generated by the offline dataset. The adaptive policy is suitable to environments where dynamics are changing and have stochasticity in the offline setting. Experiments are conducted in synthetic environments and a real - life ride - hailing platform."
SP:1a166b28cf684e0d5759bd629f6a53370d2bf11c,"This paper proposes a new method for goal - reaching reinforcement learning based on imitation learning. The main idea is to leverage the property that any trajectory is a successful demonstration for reaching the final state in that same trajectory. The authors propose a simple algorithm in which an agent continually relabels and imitates the trajectories it generates to progressively learn goal reaching behaviors from scratch. Each iteration, the agent collects new trajectories using the latest policy, and maximizes the likelihood of the actions along these trajectories under the goal that was actually reached, so as to improve the policy."

In order to reduce the problem to an optimization problem over ordinary functions, the authors introduce a nonnegative penalty function R(f ) that “ forces the support of f to be k - dimension. ” Then they present an algorithm for minimization of I(f) + R( f ), based on the idea of two - step iterative computation, where the first step is an adaptation to real data and to fake data sampled around a k-dimensional subspace found at a previous iteration, and the second step is a calculation of a new k -dimensional sub space."

SP:2fda410b9281c5e253d385bc4382ec168bc161f3,"This paper studies the problem of disparate impact on graph - structured data. Specifically, the authors focus on dyadic fairness, which articulates a fairness concept that a predictive relationship between two instances should be independent of the sensitive attributes. Based on this, they theoretically relate the graph connections to Dyadic fairness on link predictive scores in learning graph neural networks. They show that regulating weights on existing edges in a graph contributes to dyadic fair conditionally. They propose an algorithm to empirically learn a fair adjacency matrix with proper graph structural constraints for fair link prediction, and in the meanwhile preserve predictive accuracy as much as possible."
