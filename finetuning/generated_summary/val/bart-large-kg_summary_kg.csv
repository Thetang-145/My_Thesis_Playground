SP:493afcfa3fd64967785928ba3acecf3ffa6ce579,"This paper proposes a new method for learning the embedding of a sequence of trajectories in a 32-dimensional space.

In particular, the authors consider the setting where the network is pruned at the end of the training process. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a new regularization term to the regularization of the network's importance score. The authors show that this regularization can be used to improve the performance of a network under the following conditions: (1) the network needs to be pruned in a way that minimizes the change in importance of each layer in the network, and (2) the weights of the weights need to be small enough to ensure that the network does not overfit to the pruned layer.   The authors provide a theoretical analysis of the effect of these two regularization terms. They show that in the case of the first one, the network can be trained to be more important than in the second one.

SP:54da307c1f9aac020ae7e3c439653765dbd8b3fe,This paper proposes a new regularization term for the bit-width of the DNN weights. The main idea is to use a sinusoidal function to regularize the weights. This is done by using a continuous representation of the bit width. The authors show that this is equivalent to a regularization of the weights by a term that depends on the period of the training data. The paper also shows that this regularization can be seen as an extension of a previous work [1].   The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a new term that regularizes the weights of the dNN weights by computing a series of intervals. This term is shown to be equivalent to the sum of two terms: the first term is a regularizing term and the second term is an additional term that penalizes the deviation of weights from the original weights.  The authors also propose a new way of computing this term that is based on the fact that the weights can be approximated by a continuous function.

Training with larger activations results in better performance.  4. Using the same idea, they also propose to use a smaller activations during training to improve the performance of the model. "

In particular, the authors focus on the case where the training data comes from low quality instances. In this case, they show that the high quality instances have a higher risk of overfitting than the low quality ones. The authors also show that this is due to the overfitting of the training examples. The paper also shows that the training instances with high quality data tend to have higher accuracies than the ones with low quality data.    The main contribution of this paper is the analysis of the tradeoff between the two types of instances. The main finding is that the higher the quality of the instances, the higher is the risk of underfitting the instances with low accuracies. In other words, if the high instances have high accuracies and the low instances have low accuracy, then the training samples are more likely to be overfitting.

The main contribution of the paper is that it proposes to use the information of the environment as a resource to guide the learning of the language.
