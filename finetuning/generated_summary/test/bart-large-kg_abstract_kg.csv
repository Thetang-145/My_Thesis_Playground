The authors show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in terms of sparsity. "
SP:dc80fdc75bc14ae19fe4ba9b85c35ce00b12856f,"This paper studies the problem of decentralized stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in the presence of non-convex objectives. In particular, the authors consider the case where the goal is to minimize a convex function, and the communication between the workers is limited to 4 bits per parameter. In this setting, they show that the communication complexity of SGD can be reduced to $O(\sqrt{n})$ if the objective is convex. In addition, they also provide a lower bound on the communication cost."
SP:86c61a658d07ab86e2d84cef7e480bf7a06e4ddb,"This paper studies the problem of learning to predict future observations in a supervised manner. The authors propose a method to learn a model that is able to predict the future observation given the current observation. The method is based on the idea that the model should be able to infer the future observations from the current observations. They show that this can be done by using a combination of two techniques: (1) learning a latent representation of future observations, and (2) using the latent representation to infer future observations.

SP:c70479b2096a52584b242de58272ca8d8565feea,This paper studies the common representation of two correlated data variables in the VAE model. The authors propose a new regularization term to encourage the common information between the two data variables to be preserved. The paper also proposes a new VAE variant to solve the information theoretic problems. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
