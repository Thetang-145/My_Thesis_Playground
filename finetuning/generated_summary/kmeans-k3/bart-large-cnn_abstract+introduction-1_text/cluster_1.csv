SP:b19df5243359791fbaad005d6f13d7e9fdb0ff63,"This paper proposes a new multi - agent role - based learning algorithm for StarCraft II. The main idea is to decompose joint action spaces into restricted role action spaces by clustering actions according to their effects on the environment and other agents. The role selector searches in a smaller role space and at a lower temporal resolution, while the role policies learn in significantly reduced primitive action - observation spaces. The proposed method achieves state - of - the - art performance on the StarCraft II benchmark and achieves rapid transfer to new environments with three times the number of agents."
SP:7deb61890d97422a0fe141ca807f968c70ab239a,"This paper studies the behavior of the stochastic subgradient descent ( SSGD ) method applied to over - parameterized nonsmooth optimization problems that satisfy an interpolation condition. By leveraging the composite structure of the empirical risk minimization problems, the authors prove that SSGD converges, respectively, with rates O(1 / ) and O(log(1/ ) for convex and strongly - convex objectives when interpolation holds. These rates coincide with established rates for SGD methods applied to smooth problems. The analysis provides a partial explanation for the empirical observation that sometimes SGD and SSGD behave similarly for training smooth and nons mooth machine learning models."

SP:c1116fbb4d058eb6be195b5d13d19a55ba86b602,This paper proposes an optimal neural synthesis approach for multimodal program synthesis tasks in which the user intent is expressed using combination of natural language ( NL ) and input - output examples. At the core of the method is a top - down recurrent neural model that places distributions over abstract syntax trees conditioned on the NL input. This model not only allows for efficient search over the space of syntactically valid programs but also leverage automated program analysis techniques for pruning the search space based on infeasibility of partial programs with user constraints. The experimental results show that the proposed method substantially outperforms prior state - of - the - art techniques in terms of accuracy and explores fewer states during search.

First, they generate images in low - frequency bands by training a sampler in the wavelet domain. Then, they use a wavelet - based down - sampling method to train a decoder network. Since the sampler and decoder can be trained in parallel and operate on much lower dimensional spaces than end - to - end models, the training cost is substantially reduced.

The authors show that the input weights of student neurons eventually align with one of the teacher neurons at any local minima. This suggests a distinct convergence nature for “ not - too - wide ” neural networks. Theoretical justification is provided to prove that under the most basic settings, all student neurons must align with the teacher neuron at any locally minima under the theoretical justification. The methodology is extendable to more general cases, where the proof can be reduced to analyzing the properties of a special class of functions that the authors call Angular Distance ( AD ) function."

SP:92a38d7d18f07f68b8f93c61180e2cc1dddd21de,"This paper studies the long - neglected yet important effects of point sampling patterns in point cloud GANs. The authors show that sampling - insensitive discriminators produce shape point clouds with point clustering artifacts while sampling - oversensitive discriminators ( e.g. PointNet++, DGCNN, PointConv, KPConv ) fail to guide valid shape generation. They propose the concept of sampling spectrum to depict the different sampling sensitivities of discriminators and study how different evaluation metrics weigh the sampling pattern against the geometry and propose several perceptual metrics forming a sampling spectrum of metrics. Guided by the proposed sampling spectrum, they discover a middle - point sampling - aware baseline discriminator, PointNet - Mix, which improves all existing point cloud generators by a large margin on sampling - related metrics."

The authors observe that adversarial examples can manipulate the votes from primary capsules to fool CapsNet. Based on these observations, the authors propose a novel vote attack where they attack the capsules directly instead of using multi - step attack methods. The vote attack is not only effective but also efficient by circumventing the routing process. Furthermore, they integrate the vote attack into the detection - aware attack paradigm to bypass the class - conditional reconstruction based detection method."

The proposed method uses privileged information in the form of a task descriptor at train time to improve the learning of recurrent policies. The method learns an informed policy ( i.e., a policy receives as input the description of the current task ) that is used to construct task embeddings from the descriptors, and to regularize the training of the recurrent policy through parameters sharing and an auxiliary objective. This approach significantly reduces the learning sample complexity without altering the representational power of RNNs by focusing on the relevant characteristics of the task and by exploiting them efficiently."

The main idea is to leverage the property that any trajectory is a successful demonstration for reaching the final state in that same trajectory. The authors propose a simple algorithm in which an agent continually relabels and imitates the trajectories it generates to progressively learn goal reaching behaviors from scratch. Each iteration, the agent collects new trajectories using the latest policy, and maximizes the likelihood of the actions along these trajectories under the goal that was actually reached, so as to improve the policy. The proposed method outperforms value - based and policy gradient methods on several challenging robotic domains."

Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a 3x training speed - up over FastSpeech and 2x inference speed."
SP:79e9fb20d383816f54738ce70d137131ebc10290,"This paper studies the unsupervised dimension reduction problem ( UDR ) in the language of tempered distributions, i.e., the problem of approximating an empirical density function pemp(x ) by another tempered distribution q(x) whose support is in a k - dimensional subspace. The problem is reduced to the minimization of the distance between q and pemp, D(q, pemp ) over a set of generalized functions. This infinite - dimensional formulation allows to establish a connection with another classical problem of data science — the sufficient dimension reduction ( SDR ). An algorithm for solving the first problem induces an algorithm for the second and vice versa. The paper also introduces a nonnegative penalty function R(f ) that “forces ” the support of f to be k -dimensional."

It shows that the convex region near a desirable model with guaranteed generalization enlarges as the neural network model is pruned, indicating the structural importance of a winning ticket.

In particular, the authors propose a formalism to explain the phenomenon that arises when cross - entropy loss is minimized by capturing only a subset of features relevant for the task, despite the presence of other predictive features that fail to be discovered. Theoretical properties of learning dynamics during gradient descent are identified that lead to this imbalance, and the authors prove that such a situation can be expected given certain statistical structure in training data. Based on the proposed formalism, they develop a novel regularization method aimed at decoupling feature learning dynamics, improving accuracy and robustness in cases hindered by gradient starvation."

SP:a3632b773143dfb3a8f104c6b658dfa1167d155b,"This paper studies the problem of generating sequences directly from undirected neural sequence models. In particular, the authors propose a generalized model of sequence generation that unifies decoding in directed and undirectED models. The proposed framework models the process of generation rather than a resulting sequence, and under this framework, they derive various neural sequences models as special cases. This unification enables them to adapt decoding algorithms originally developed for directed sequence models to undirecting models."
