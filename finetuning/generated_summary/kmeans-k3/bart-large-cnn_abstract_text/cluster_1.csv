SP:b19df5243359791fbaad005d6f13d7e9fdb0ff63,"This paper proposes to decompose joint action spaces into restricted role action spaces by clustering actions according to their effects on the environment and other agents. Learning a role selector based on action effects makes role discovery much easier because it forms a bi - level learning hierarchy : the role selector searches in a smaller role space and at a lower temporal resolution, while role policies learn in significantly reduced primitive action - observation spaces. The proposed method ( 1 ) outperforms the current state - of - the - art MARL algorithms on 9 of the 14 scenarios that comprise the challenging StarCraft II benchmark and ( 2 ) achieves rapid transfer to new environments with three times the number of agents."
SP:7deb61890d97422a0fe141ca807f968c70ab239a,"This paper studies the behaviour of the stochastic subgradient descent ( SSGD ) method applied to over - parameterized nonsmooth optimization problems that satisfy an interpolation condition. By leveraging the composite structure of the empirical risk minimization problems, the authors prove that SSGD converges, respectively, with rates O(1 / ) and O(log(1/ ) for convex and strongly - convex objectives when interpolation holds. These rates coincide with established rates for the stoChastic gradient descent ( SGD ) algorithm applied to smooth problems. The analysis provides a partial explanation for the empirical observation that sometimes SGD and SSGD behave similarly for training smooth   machine learning models."

The experiments are conducted on a number of machine translation tasks and language modeling tasks.  "
SP:ba9f1d4738ec67a440346f3ac6c4cf35f7232077,This paper studies steerable kernels constructed by filter transform. The authors show that the kernel constructed by the filter transform can be interpreted in the group representation theory.

The authors show that such underestimation bias may lead to multiple non - optimal fixed points under an approximate Bellman operator. To address the concerns of converging to non - optimal stationary solutions, the authors propose a simple but effective approach as a partial fix for the underestimation biases in double Q learning.

The training is done by training a sampler in the wavelet domain and a decoder network in the low - frequency band. The sampler and decoder can be trained in parallel and operate on much lower dimensional spaces than end - to - end models. As a result, the training cost is substantially reduced.

Through extensive experiments, the authors show that sampling - insensitive discriminators produce shape point clouds with point clustering artifacts while sampling - oversensitive discriminators ( e.g. PointNet++, DGCNN, PointConv, KPConv ) fail to guide valid shape generation. The authors further study how different evaluation metrics weigh the sampling pattern against the geometry and propose several perceptual metrics forming a sampling spectrum of metrics. Guided by the proposed sampling spectrum, the proposed PointNet - Mix baseline discriminator improves all existing point cloud generators by a large margin on sampling - related metrics."

The main idea is to leverage the property that any trajectory is a successful demonstration for reaching the final state in that same trajectory. The authors propose a simple algorithm in which an agent continually relabels and imitates the trajectories it generates to progressively learn goal reaching behaviors from scratch. The agent collects new trajectories using the latest policy, and maximizes the likelihood of the actions along these trajectories under the goal that was actually reached, and formally show that this iterated supervised learning procedure optimizes a bound on the RL objective."

SP:f03c50f15022c4f56ac2b3085354ffed38ad1145,"This paper proposes a new method for imitation learning based on generative adversarial learning. The key idea is to regularize the discriminator network with a latent representation of the optimal state and actions taken by the expert. This representation is regularized through mutual information constraints to incentivize learning only features that encode information about the completion levels of the task being demonstrated. This allows the agent to learn directly from high dimensional observations of an expert performing a task, by making use of the latent representation inside the discriminators network."

The paper characterizes the performance of training a pruned network by analyzing the geometric structure of the objective function and the sample complexity to achieve zero generalization error. The convex region near a desirable model with guaranteed generalization enlarges as the neural network model is pruned, indicating the structural importance of a winning ticket.

The proposed measure is based on the standard GAI, which is a trade - off between the accuracy of the classifier and the accuracy on the perturbed data.

SP:3cac7a2c310165ed0de46d8e5546c3bfbd639158,"This paper introduces Fast Linearized Adaptive Policy ( FLAP ), a new metareinforcement learning ( meta - RL ) method that is able to extrapolate well to out - of - distribution tasks without the need to reuse data from training, and adapt almost instantaneously with the need of only a few samples during testing. FLAP builds upon the idea of learning a shared linear representation of the policy so that when adapting to a new task, it suffices to predict a set of linear weights. A separate adapter network is trained simultaneously with the policy such that during adaptation, it can directly use the adapter network to predict these linear weights instead of updating a meta - policy via gradient descent. The application of the separate feed - forward network not only speeds up the adaptation run - time significantly, but also generalizes extremely well to very different tasks that prior Meta - RL methods fail to generalize to."
