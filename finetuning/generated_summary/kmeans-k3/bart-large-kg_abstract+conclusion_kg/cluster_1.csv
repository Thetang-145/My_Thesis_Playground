SP:dc80fdc75bc14ae19fe4ba9b85c35ce00b12856f,"This paper studies the problem of communication over stochastic gradient descent ( SGD ) in a decentralized setting, where the goal is to communicate a message to a server in time $ t$ bits. The communication is done in two steps : first, the server transmits the message to the server, and then the server receives the message back in the form of a compressed version of the message. The goal of the communication is to minimize the time it takes for the server to decode the message, which can be thought of as the number of bits the server needs to decode.   The paper shows that if the server has access to $ n$ bits, then it is possible to solve the problem in $ O(1/\sqrt{T})$ time, where $ T$ is the length of the channel. The paper also shows that this problem can be solved in polynomial time."
